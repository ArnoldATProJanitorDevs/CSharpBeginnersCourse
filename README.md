# Course Topics and Expectation

Welcome to C# explained by games course. I will take you on my learning journey through the glorious Kingdom of C#. We are going to explore the lands by creating very well-known game mechanics out of our favorite games such as **Counter-Strike GO, World of Warcraft, Grand Theft Auto, Diablo, Age of Empires 2, and many more of your favorite games** to create mechanics as life points, looting, healing potions & items, and many more

We start our Journey at the Bootcamp, head straight into our first fight, wander to the Castle of C#, looting the entire treasury, and climb a mountain to successfully place our flag at the top of it!

Finally, we play a game with the mind-reader Gandolon! It includes also a graduation exercise with a quiz in part 3!
